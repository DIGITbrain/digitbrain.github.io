unit:
  description: human readable unit symbol, here N for Newton
  type: string
  example: N

exponent:
  description: |
    7-tuple of integer-valued exponents*- Ordered list of SI base units

    - 1st entry: Length - meter (m)
    - 2nd entry: Time - second (s)
    - 3rd entry: Amount of substance - mole (mol)
    - 4th entry: Electric current - ampere (A)
    - 5th entry: Temperature - kelvin (K)
    - 6th entry: Luminous intensity - candela (cd)
    - 7th entry: Mass - kilogram (kg)
      
    !!! note "Explanation"

        the exponents reference the above SI base units in the
        corresponding order to describe the unit w.r.t. the base SI units,
        the entries [1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] thus denote m s⁻² kg, i.e., Newton
  type: number[]
  notify: false

offset:
  description: |
    default value is 0*- allows to offset the values by adding a constant,
    e.g., Celsius is offset by 273.15 relative to Kelvin (C + 273.15 = K).
    !!! warning
    
        For absolute temperatures only! For temperature
        *differences*, this must be omitted!
  type: number
  notify: false

scale:
  description: |
    default value is 1*- allows to scale the values into base units,
    e.g., 1e-3 to describe mm (millimeters) in terms of m (meters)
  type: number
  example: 1
