# DIGITbrain Project Documentation

## About

Compared to the digital twin concept, which is already increasingly used by
manufacturing companies today, the DIGITbrain concept will go one step further
by developing the 'Digital Product Brain' which will store data throughout the
entire life cycle of a production line or a machine.

By collecting all this data, it will be possible to customise and set-up machines
/ production assets for very specific manufacturing tasks whenever needed. This will
enable a new manufacturing model, called Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS), which will
allow for on-demand production of much more specialised products, even in smaller
quantities and still in an economically profitable way.

## Using this documentation

The primary aim of this documentation is to serve as a point of reference for
providers and consumers of the different assets in DIGITbrain. These include
**Microservices**, **Algorithms**, **Model** and **Data**, as well as
**Behaviours** and **DMA Tuples**.

### Assets

Please navigate using the available navigation bars. Information on the
fields available on each asset is available in [detail](attributes)
or as an [overview](tables). 

**If you're new to DIGITbrain, refer to [Getting Started](start).**

### Examples

Several examples are already running on the DIGITbrain platform. A complete
specification has been provided for each of these examples and it is hoped that these
can serve as a guide for users looking to describe their own assets for use in
the DIGITbrain platform.

**See these [examples here](examples/). Note that some field names may appear differently.**

## Technical Information

Much of the information presented across this site is automatically
updated based on the schemas defined in the Asset Metadata Registry, which stores
information about the different assets that are created on the platform. It is
up-to-date with the very latest production version.
