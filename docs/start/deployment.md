# Deployments in DIGITbrain

## Introduction

A deployment in DIGITbrain specifies the infrastructure that a desired DMA
Tuple will be deployed across. Here it is necessary to provide details on the
type of infrastructure that this deployment will define, along with all the
configuration details required by that infrastructure type.

## Pre-requisites

For most DMA Tuples in DIGITbrain, a common set of Deployments will be suitable.
Required IDs that describe that common set are available in the documentation
that follows below.

For some workloads with very specific hardware or software requirements, or
for those who require direct access to underlying virtual machines, it may
be necessary to raise a ticket with the administrator of your CloudBroker Platform.

Where bring-your-own edges are used, DIGITbrain currently supports the following

- ARM or x86 Architectures
- Common Linux Distributions
- Minimum 1 CPU, 1GB RAM and 5GB free disk space

## Describing Deployments

For a closer look at the fields available for Deployments, use the following resources:

- [Deployments in Detail](/attributes/deployment) for an itemised listing of fields

## Further reading...

This section takes an in-depth look at some of the more complex fields
required to describe this asset:

`type`

:   **Required**– DIGITbrain supports cloud infrastructure deployed via the
CloudBroker platform, or bring-your-own Linux-based Edge devices. This should
be specified in this field. The other metadata in this section should be
completed according to the type (e.g. CloudBroker-specific metadata is not required
if `type: edge`)

    === "cloudbroker"

        ``` yaml
        type: cloudbroker
        cloudbroker:
          deployment_id:
          instance_type_id:
          key_pair_id:
          opened_port:
          endpoint:
        ```

    === "edge"

        ``` yaml
        type: edge
        edge:
          endpoint:
        ```

`cloudbroker.deployment_id`

:   **Required**– A CloudBroker deployment ties together software,
resource and region. Indicative IDs are given below, but any LTS
Debian-based Linux distribution should be supported. It is recommended
to use the MiCADO-Optimised deployment.


    === "MiCADO-Optimised"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          deployment_id: 27f3dd48-1dac-4d3c-8b7f-39338ed55543
        ```

    === "Ubuntu 20.04"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          deployment_id: 16b1e2d4-3a2c-406e-8c45-5637099021f0
        ```

    === "Ubuntu 18.04"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          deployment_id: 5a081b54-8992-4ff7-8a21-74e425062507
        ```

    === "Custom"
        ``` html
        <!-- Find your deployment_id at this URL  -->
        https://<cloudbroker-endpoint>/deployments/<deployment-id>
        ```

`cloudbroker.instance_type_id`

:   **Required**– The CloudBroker instance type defines the CPU and RAM
that will be available on the infrastructure. Indicative IDs are given
below. The minimum requirements are a 2 vCPU/2GB RAM

    === "2 vCPU | 4GB RAM"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          instance_type_id: ca727925-a5ca-4697-b2c3-8788d82457d5
        ```

    === "4 vCPU | 8GB RAM"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          instance_type_id: ffb42759-fb52-4401-9c75-889ea0ed9602
        ```

    === "8 vCPU | 16GB RAM"

        ``` yaml
        cloudbroker:
          instance_type_id: 664330f3-42b1-4f52-a675-fd182a21ef51

        ```

`cloudbroker.key_pair_id`

:   **Optional**– The CloudBroker ID for an SSH key pair, for remote
access to the infrastructure. A key pair must be created on the platform.

    === "Custom"
        ``` html
        <!-- Find your key_pair_id at this URL  -->
        https://<cloudbroker-endpoint>/key_pairs/<key-pair-id>
        ```

`cloudbroker.opened_port`

:   **Optional**– A comma-separated string listing port numbers,
which will be opened on the instance (both TCP and UDP protocols
will be affected).

    === "Custom"

`edge.endpoint`
