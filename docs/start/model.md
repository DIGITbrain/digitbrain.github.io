# Models in DIGITbrain

## Introduction

A model in DIGITbrain is an asset that contains the knowledge related to a specific industrial product instance (i.e., a concrete manufacturing machine or production line), which can hence describe and forecast the behavior of such an instance when specific operating conditions are given (n.b., the process of forecasting a system’s behavior according to specific operating conditions is also known as model evaluation).

## Pre-requisites

Models must be accessible from Algorithms for evaluation, thus they must be located in the specific DIGITbrain Model repository.

## Describing Models

For a closer look at the fields available for Models, use the following resources:

- [Models in Detail](/attributes/model) for an itemised listing of fields
- [Models Overview](/tables/model) for a table-formatted overview

## Further reading...

This section takes an in-depth look at some of the **Parameters** fields required to describe this asset:

`In-slots` and `Outputs`

These fields have the same structure, detailed below. They include, as an array of objects, all inputs and parameters (_In-slots_) or _Outputs_ to be defined for the Model to be evaluated, such as:

* `Key` This field is of the type of group.key, e.g., type.name of each variable
* `Name` This is a human-readable name of the variable
* `Dimensions` This field describes the number of dimensions of the variable to treat it as a scalar, a vector field, etc.
* `Is-continuous` This field describes whether the variable is continuous or discrete
* `Units` This field contains several subkeys, as it follows
  * `Unit` This field indicates the unit of measurement of the variable (e.g., s, Pa, m/s, etc.)
  * `Exponents` This field contains an array of numbers defining exponents for the 7 base SI units, i.e., Length - meter (m), Time - second (s), Amount of substance - mole (mole), Electric current - ampere (A), Temperature - Kelvin (K), Luminous intensity - candela (cd), Mass - kilogram (kg). For example the derived 
 For example _N_ would be represented by the array {1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}
  * `Offset` This field contains the offset scale, if needed (e.g., K to ºC conversion)
  * `Scale` This field describes the order of magnitude of the measurement unit scale, e.g., 10^-3 for values expressed mm         
* `Default-value` This field contains the default value for variable
* `Ranges` This field is an array containing both max and min values of the variable

`CosimSolverInfo`

:   **Optional:** This object is made up of several fields that are optional and only needed in case of co-simulation `Type` (**Description** field) only. The additional fields needed in co-simulation are:
* `Dependant FMUs` Contains a field with an array of URI for dependant FMU localisation
* `OS Requirements` Contains a set of fields defining OS requirements for co-simulation
* `Hardware Requirements` Contains a set of fields defining Hardware requirements for co-simulation
